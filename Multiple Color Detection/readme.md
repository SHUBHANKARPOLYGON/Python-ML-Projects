# Multiple Color Detection in Real-Time

This Python project demonstrates real-time color detection using OpenCV and the webcam. The program captures video from the webcam and detects multiple colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Purple) within the video stream. When a color is detected, the program draws a bounding box around the colored object and labels it with the detected color.

## Features

- Real-time color detection with webcam input.
- Supports multiple colors: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Purple.
- Draws bounding boxes around detected colors.
- Labels each detected color with its name.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- A working webcam

## Installation
